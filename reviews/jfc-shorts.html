<h1>MIT Science Fiction Society Reviews: John Carr's Reading Project</h1>

<p>Some time ago, John Carr decided to embark on an ambitious, perhaps
foolish or even madness-inducing project: to read one book from every
stack of shelves in the reserve stacks, by an author he had never read
before.  On this page, you will find his microsummaries of the good,
the bad, and the outright bizarre that he has encountered so far on
his quest to confirm Sturgeon's Law.

<h3>JFC's microsummaries:</h3>
<ul>
<li><i>Resenting the Hero</i>, Moira J. Moore (2006)
<p>
By the cover, this is another John Moore comic fantasy.
On closer examination, the author's first name is spelled
Moira.  When you get into reading it you realize it's not
like that at all.
<p>
Fate reaches out and taps people in pairs, one a Source whose
job is to save the world and one a Shield whose job is to
save the Source from himself and the effects of his power.
They can only work as a team.  They must work as a team,
together for the rest of their lives, love each other or
hate each other.
<p>
The author hints that this is a colony world gone bad rather than
Fantasyland but the setting looks like pre-Industrial Revolution
Europe plus some weird stuff so it quacks like a fantasy.
<p>
I suppose I liked it -- I read the sequel too -- but I'm
pretty sure I didn't care as much about the characters
and situation as the author meant me to.  Perhaps I'm
not a romantic at heart.
<li><i>The Arsenal Out of Time</i>, David McDaniel (1967)
<p>
Earth spies try to take control of the great weapons
left behind by an ancient race before the rebellious
colonies get their hands on it.  Includes obligatory
tough girl sidekick and love interest.
<p>
About what you would expect from a pre-New Wave SF spy novel.
<li><i>2018 A.D. or: The King Kong Blues</i>, Sam J. Lundwall (1974)
<p>
Set in Dystopian future Sweden.  What appears to be an exaggerated
satire on cultural trends, including an accurate prediction of the
rise of reality TV, is revealed in the appendix to be based on true
stories from the late 1960s and early 1970s.  A Swedish correspondent
tells me the author stopped writing after receiving some sort of
genius grant.
<p>
Recommended.
<li><i>The Bones of God</i>, Stephen Leigh (1986)
<p>
Is a man who hears voices in hyperspace delusional
or the Messiah?  Does it matter?
<p>
Better than I expected given the premise of God talking
to starship pilots.
<li><i>Robots Have No Tails</i>, Henry Kuttner (1952)
<p>
Humorous short fiction about a mad scientist inventor
and his robot sidekick.
<p>
Funny but old fashioned.
<li><i>The Mind Benders</i>, James Kennaway (1963)
<p>
Inspired by the postwar sensory deprivation experiments.
<p>
I didn't feel there was enough story in here.
I may have been judging it by science fiction
standards rather than mainstream literary standards.
<li><i>The Day the Earth Froze</i>, Gerald Hatch (1963)
<p>
Cold War rivalry freezes the earth.  Everything dies
except humans, but that's OK.  Oh, and there's a girl
torn between two guys and a guy torn between two girls.
<p>
The science is kind of screwy.  In the novel, mutual
annihilation of matter and antimatter leaves behind a
sort of ash with bad properties.
<p>
A below-average entry in the field of disaster fiction.
<li><i>King Solomon's Mines</i>, H. Rider Haggard (1885)
<p>
Classic story of a search for long-lost treasure with
a meeting with an alien culture thrown in.  While the
narrator makes a point of saying that there were no
women on the expedition nor should there be women on
such an expedition, the stills in this 1980s movie tie-in
edition show Hollywood's obligatory female lead tagging
along.
<p>
My middle school library also classified this book as
science fiction.  It has characteristics found in some
subgenres of  science fiction and fantasy, a voyage of
exploration to see the artifacts of the elder races.
However, it is not <i>King Solomon's Mines</i> but the
scientific romances of Haggard's contemporaries that
gave birth to modern science fiction.
<p>
The modern reader may find it more interesting to observe
the alien-to-us 19th century European frontier culture than
the alien-to-them depths of blackest Africa.
<li><i>Cortez on Jupiter</i>, Ernest Hogan (1990)
<p>
This is a distant cousin to a favorite sub-genre, the
alien death trap story.  The young narrator journeys
from future California to Jupiter in order to face
his destiny in the reality TV of the future.  Will he
be able to make contact with aliens, or will he die
trying like those who came before him?
<p>
I feel like I shouldn't like this, but I did anyway.
In contrast I felt like I should like <i>Wheelers</i> by
Stewart and Cohen but I didn't.  <i>Wheelers</i> features
a trip to Jupiter and a boy who can communicate with
any animal.  I could read it again imagining Rex
Harrison as the boy, but I won't.
<li><i>The Red Napoleon</i>, Floyd Gibbons (1929)
<p>
An Asian man conquers much of the world, kind of like in
M. J.  Engh's <i>Arslan</i>, until Americans rally to defeat
him in a climactic naval battle.
<p>
This edition comes with a review in the back calling it
unremarkable and making one wonder why the publisher chose
to reprint it decades later.  I thought it better than the
reviewer but much of the interest was in the view of the
1930s as seen from the 1920s.
<p>
It is two books, perhaps -- the personal story of a witness
to the rise of an Emperor, and the dry story of a global war.
The modern reader might or might not find the racial conflict
worth reading.
<li><i>Dark Universe</i>, Daniel F. Galouye (1961)
<p>
In a post-nuclear underground colony, humans see their
surroundings by sound or thermal infrared.  The idea that
humans would react to darkness and radiation by evolving
new senses was good.  Perhaps it was not totally convincing
to some modern readers, but I bought it for purposes of the
novel.
<p>
I was ambivalent in spite of the interesting ideas.  A
man who saw me reading it said he thought it very good.
<li><i>The Day the Oceans Overflowed</i>, Charles Fontenay (1964)
<p>
Nuclear scientists melt the polar ice cap and cause a Biblical
flood.  Survivors are rescued by Noah's Ark.  The story is told
on a personal scale rather than an epic scale.
<p>
Another below-average entry in the field of disaster fiction.
<li><i>The Best Laid Schemes</i>, Larry Eisenberg (1971)
<p>
Humorous short SF, possibly what <i>Robots Have No Tails</i>
would have been written two decades later in an academic
setting.
<p>
Funny.  Some of the stories are a bit dated, being
nearly 40 year old gadget SF.  Recommended.
<li><i>Spearmen of Arn</i>, Del DowDell (1978)
<p>
Human transported to another world dons a loincloth
and spear to become the great liberator.  In the same
genre as early Gor.
<p>
Undistinguished alternate world adventure novel.
You might as well read <i>Tarnsman of Gor</i>.  People
will respect you more for it.  Or disrespect you
more.
<li><i>Genesis Two</i>, L.P Davies (1970?)
<p>
A tiny village is transported to an uninhabited
future earth.  The most interesting idea is the
vision of evolution of plant life post-humanity.
<li><i>The Planet of the Blind</i>, Paul Corey (1968)
<p>
A man can't have his ex-wife, so he clings to his daughter.
He can't have his daughter, so he clings to this blind alien
girl who thinks he's a great kisser.  There's also a superficial
morality tale about IQ tests not being a complete measure of a
person's worth.
<p>
Not much worth reading here.  The idea of alternate senses
has been better done elsewhere.
<li><i>Monitor Found In Orbit</i>, Michael G. Coney (1974)
<p>
Short stories.  I loved the unexpected meaning of the title story,
which turned from annoying stream of consciousness New Wave to
something good with the twist ending.
<p>
Recommended.
<li><i>The Shores of Kansas</i>, Robert Chilson (1976)
<p>
Time travel to the age of dinosaurs.  Some people have an ability to
step back in time.  Most can go decades or centuries.  One can go
millions of years.  Our hero has difficulties with girls because of
his rejection by a manipulative woman when he was a nobody instead of
a world-famous time traveler.  In spite of his psychological problems
he sometimes submits to time travel groupies, two at a time if
necessary.  The cover reminded me of Keith Laumer's <i>Dinosaur Beach</i>.
<p>
Some interesting ideas, but unremarkable.
<li><i>Cycle of Nemesis</i>, Kenneth Bulmer (1967)
<p>
A future man is unsurprised to encounter a person being chased
by agents of a prehistoric god and joins forces to fight the
menace.
<p>
Unimpressive.
<li><i>Up Above the World</i>, Paul Bowles (1968)
<p>
A couple vacationing in Central America meet up with and fall victim
to an evil man who has an evil plot I didn't understand.  This book
is not science fiction at all despite being found in a science fiction
library.
<p>
Good, not great.
<li><i>The Pyramids from Space</i>, Jack Bertin (1970?)
<p>
Ingredients: male hero, attractive daughter of scientist who
needs help rescuing her father, alien artifacts, dinosaurs.
<p>
This cliched and superficial novel nevertheless has a couple
ingredients that showed up in later, greater works.
Areas where gravity becomes strong and deadly are also found
in the Strugatsky brothers' <i>Roadside Picnic</i>, along with the
idea that man is to higher intelligence as ants are to man
(not an original notion, I'm sure).  Areas of high gravity may
have been to divide the world into regions each of which was a
specially crafted zoo for particular captives.  This is
reminiscent of Jack Chalker's <i>Well World</i> series and Dean Ing's
novel <i>Cathouse</i> (from the Man-Kzin Wars series).  A depression
full of mobile rocks reminded me of a scene from Chaos in Roger
Zelazny's <i>Amber</i> series.
<p>
But the scattering of good ideas doesn't blend into a good book.
<li><i>The Garments of Caean</i>, Barrington J. Bayley (1976)
<p>
If the clothes make the man -- and they do, they really do -- who
makes the clothes?
<p>
Recommended.
<li><i>The Devil and W. Kaspar</i>, Benjamin Appel (1977?)
<p>
A black Buddhist is recruited by one of that religion's deities
as an agent to save the world from devastating nuclear retaliation
after an accidental catastrophe is mistaken for an attack.
<p>
It has some funny parts while managing not to impress me.
<li><i>Saucer Hill</i>, Paul Adler (1979)
<p>
The cover and opening pages reminded me of the Heaven's Gate cult,
which committed mass suicide in order to be taken away by aliens.
This book may be best read in the late 1960s with the aid of some
serious drugs.  Certainly if there is a deeper meaning to the
weirdness it escaped me.
<p>
Impressive in its weirdness, though not in its quality.
<li><i>A Walk Out of the World</i>, Ruth Nichols (1969)
<p>
YA novel.  Siblings take a walk out of their boring city
and end up in fairyland where they are much more important
people doing much more important things.
<p>
Generic YA fantasy.  Not bad.  Best left to its intended audience.
<li><i>A Report from Group 17</i>, Robert C. O'Brien (1972)
<p>
When I started reading this book I more or less dismissed it as a
generic cold war novel about Soviet bioterror experiments run by
Nazi scientists.  Perhaps a spy novel, perhaps a proto-technothriller.
By the time I got to the 1970s card stock cigarette ad in the middle
I realized I had misjudged both the plot and the quality.  There was
a scientific puzzle behind the facade.
<p>
The science was a bit weak, unfortunately.  I couldn't buy the central
biological premise.  Also, a scene where a mother and father chipmunk
rescue their babies is contrary to fact.  Male chipmunks do not help
raise babies.  This is true of the squirrel family in general.
<li><i>The Crying of Lot 49</i>, Thomas Pynchon (1966)
<p>
A screaming came across my brain as I realized that no matter
how much I tried, how long I stared at a page-long sentence,
blurring like mist through my tortured eyes, how much I stood
back and tried to diagram the sentence, the chapter, the characters,
the plot in my head, struggling against the distractions in the
library around me, I was destined never to fully understand this
tale of a postal conspiracy stretching from the Holy Roman Empire
across time and space to drug-addled Twentieth Century California
and the mystery woman named Oedipa (Oedipa?) whose journeys up and
down the Golden State threatened to shake the foundations of
the Vatican Library, obscure playwrights, and philately itself.
<p>
I laughed occasionally.  Out loud.  I never imagined that Pynchon
would be funny.  But I still ended up feeling that I missed the
point.
<li><i>Whom the Gods Would Slay</i>, Ivar Jorgensen (1969)
<p>
In the grim darkness of the tenth century, more or less, a
Martian shoots dead a pair of cute, innocent, curious squirrels.
<p>
In other news Mars is being destroyed by a wall of ants reminiscent
of the scientific accident in the Strugatsky brothers' <i>Far Rainbow</i>.
The last survivors use the telepathic powers of their enormous heads
to direct Vikings where they need to go to save the world from the
woman who gave birth to the ant plague.
<p>
This is a fast, simple read, probably aimed closer to the men's
adventure market than the traditional SF or fantasy market.  Martians
are Martian, with tiny, obsolete bodies that exist as life support
systems for their giant brains.  Heroes are heroes, big, tough, and
smart.  Women are women, erotic and pneumatic.  Christians are
Christian, in the traditional sense where they do nice things and
also lay waste to their enemies.
<p>
But at the end of the book the squirrels are still dead.
<li><i>Our Space-Craft Is Missing!</i>, Paul Richards (1970)
<p>
As both the United States and Soviet Union blame each other for the
destruction of spacecraft the President's top troubleshooter seeks
to find anybody else to blame.  He has only days to work because
the Soviet Union would rather start a global nuclear war than delay
its next launch while they figure out what went wrong.
<p>
As luck would have it, on his journey he becomes reacquainted with a
beautiful woman he has lusted after for some time and forces her to
have sex with him, an act which is not presented as rape because in
the tradition of such fiction she decides she likes it halfway through.
He, on the other hand, is able to fend off a nymphomaniac whose ugliness
foreshadows her evil.  Lucky him.
<p>
In retrospect, the villain may have been inevitable for a work out
of that period.
<li><i>Mindfogger</i>, Michael Rogers (1973)
<p>
A young genius inventor full of 1960s idealism has an
invention too terrible to let the government get its hands on,
so he picks up an easy young women of the sort that were evidently
easy to come by in Southern California at the time and tries to
hide from his past.  The notion that progress is decay reminds me
of Vonnegut's <i>Player Piano</i>.  The title suggests a relationship
to Spider Robinson's <i>Mindkiller</i> but the plot leads in another
direction.
<p>
The last few pages throw in a plot twist I especially dislike,
that undermines the rest of the book.  The book starts from the
idea, "what if there were a device that could affect the mind
in this way."  The ending throws in another idea of greater
magnitude that would put the book in a different subgenre if
exposed earlier.  I had a similar problem with Michael
Marshall Smith mixing genres in <i>Only Forward</i> and
<i>Spares</i>.
<p>
There are two references to the squirrel family.
<p>
On page 74, "Lila is always framed in the whiteness of the bed linen
with the natural curved grace of a badger or marmot against a snowbank."
(The book is written in the present tense.)
<p>
On page 96, battery stockpiles are scattered around the country
"like the caches of a hyperactive ground squirrel."  In fact
within the squirrel family scatter hoarding is most characteristic
of tree squirrels of genus <i>Sciurus.</i>  Ground squirrels tend to
hibernate in the winter, sleeping or eating in their burrow,
rather than ranging widely above ground to recover stored food.
<li><i>The Golden Kazoo</i>, John G. Schneider (1956)
<p>
This 1956 novel, a satire on politics, advertising, and television,
takes a humorous look at the 1960 presidential campaign.  Dogs and
sex have been done to death, so what shall be the theme this year,
the first year when both parties fully embrace Madison Avenue as
the road to the White House?  The year when the policies are
determined by the advertising experts rather than the politicians
too ignorant to sell themselves.
<p>
1960 is the year of the voter as consumer.  "The poor, dumb, beat-up,
oppressed, cheated, neglected, ignored and humiliated consumer.
The stupid, unorganized, helpless, nameless, faceless, numberless
consumer.  The ridiculous, prat-falling clown, the almighty slob."
<p>
There is an incidental reference to the ad campaign that
threatens to kill your baby unless you buy the right brand
of tires.  I had not realized it was so old.
<li><i>Donovan's Brain</i>, Curt Siodmak (1941?)
<p>
A classic that I had never read.
<p>
Now we all know what happens to disembodied brains.
Freed from the confines of the flesh they grow more
powerful.  In the early 20th century, we didn't know
that, and <i>Donovan's Brain</i> was key to introducing
the concept.
<p>
Worth reading.
<li><i>The Night Life of the Gods</i>, Thorne Smith (1931)
<p>
This novel is the ancestor of the modern comic fantasy.
It was was evidently considered quite racy for the 1930s.
There is suggestive language, onscreen kissing, and
indications that sex may have occurred offstage.
<p>
Our hero is a stock character, the bachelor inventor uncle.
His inventions tend to explode, but he has finally produced
a working device.
<p>
An uncle does not exist in a vacuum.  He is paired
with a nice niece, a naughty nephew, and the rest
of his annoying sister's annoying family.
<p>
The style wobbles between comedy and farce.  One scene
degenerates into fish slapping.  Much of the novel concerns
the activities of statues of the Greek gods who have been
brought to life by uncle's invention.
<p>
Squirrels are scarce, only mentioned once:
"The events of the night had not dealt kindly with
Mr. Wetmore Brightly.  He had sustained a double
loss.  His scarecrow had been outraged and his
watchdog turned to stone.  On the other hand, the
squirrels in the forest had a new mystery to solve."
<p>
Overall, funny at times but most readers will prefer
a more modern style.
<li><i>Memory Blank</i>, John E. Stith (1986)
<p>
You wake up with no memory, knowing something bad must have
happened.  Now what?
<p>
The stock opening leads to a decent detective story, set in
a 22nd century orbital habitat on the verge of launching a
colony ship to the stars.
<p>
It is interesting to note that the portable personal AI our
protagonist carries has a personality but very limited memory.
Less than 25 years after the novel was written the amount of
memory that can fit into a portable device is more than
sufficient to hold a lifetime of conversation compressed to
text plus annotations.  While the memory limitation is
necessary to the plot, I'm not sure it is even self-consistent.
<p>
The portable computer also serves as a video phone, and very
well, but even in the future people still retain landlines.
<p>
I would have liked this story more when it was published.
I intend to read more Stith novels, some day.
<li><i>Guardians of the Gate</i>, Louis and Jacqueline Trimble (1972)
<p>
There are prophecies and ugly evil lands and beautiful good
lands and old gods imprisoned under the earth and a man and
a woman fated to breed and produce a powerful heir.
<p>
In the vein of old Zelazny -- and more generally much of the
genre in the 1960s -- science fiction and fantasy elements
mix.  Our Hero carries a magic staff, for example, that is
clearly high technology left by the ancestors from the stars.
<p>
The style is definitely not New Wave.  It is much more simple
and straightforward.  Too simple, at times.
<p>
People not living on the icecap call ice "frozen rain."  The intent
is to suggest strangeness but the effect is distracting.  The Eskimos
are reputed to have many words for snow -- but residents of temperate
America do too.
<p>
The evil king has his enemies executed by placing them at a ring of
archers armed with poison arrows.  The results are predictable.
<p>
Our Hero doubles as a stage magician and freely uses mechanical
aids in addition to his magic/technological staff to trick people
into believing he has more power than he does.  I was reminded of
Barry Longyear's <i>Circus World</i>.  Fortunately for the forces of
Good, nobody thinks to effectively search Our Hero and relieve
him of his implements of distraction and destruction, other than
the obvious magic staff.
<p>
One country is a prison colony that grew up.  I thought of
Australia, but the author does not seem to have followed up
on that parallel.
<li><i>Visit to a Small Planet</i>, Gore Vidal (1957?)
<p>
Humorous play about a troublemaking alien who lands in Virginia
during the Cold War.  And I have little else to say.  It was
worth my time.
<li><i>Spacejacks</i>, Robert Wells (1975)
<p>
I have mixed feelings about this book.  It was good in parts
and felt disjointed in others.  I did not feel the sense of
struggling to save humanity like I was intended to -- at least,
as the cover blurb would have me believe I was intended to.
The experience was kind of like reading a C. J. Cherryh novel,
but with less conviction that there was an underlying plot and
it would all make sense if only my reading skills were up to
the task.
<p>
Our heroes are spaceborne salvage and rescue specialists, kind
of like a tow truck carrying an EMT.  A new competitor has
appeared with a spiffy new ship.  This is apparently a bad
thing.
<p>
Part of my problem was point of view, or more specifically the
breaks from the point of view rule I expected.  The author gives
us occasional glimpses of the enemy, enough to break the pattern
of watching one set of characters take on the problem but not
enough to tell both sides of the story.  We also get authorial
commentary on the physical attributes of the female character.
She has a pouting navel, though what that is or why the reader
ought to know I couldn't tell you.
<p>
At the end when all was revealed I doubted that it followed
necessarily from what had gone before.
<li><i>The Doom Stone</i>, Cornell Woolrich (1960)
<p>
A cursed artifact -- a diamond stolen from the temple where it
belongs -- makes its way around the world bringing doom and
despair on those who would possess it.  We take a trip to
colonial India, revolutionary France, reconstruction era
New Orleans, and wartime Japan.
<p>
The author's lapses into omniscient narration are distracting.
On page 96 the evil lead of that section refers to his minion
as a "cowardly little chipmunk" for refusing to rob the diamond
from a dying woman.   The name chipmunk is actually a slight
anachronism.  The alternate name "chipping squirrel" and alternate
spelling chipmonk were more common in the 19th century.  But with
any book set in a different culture, the author has to decide what
to translate and what to leave in local dialect.
<p>
The author's lapses into omniscient narration are a bit distracting.
Overall, a readable but not exceptional adventure-with-a-trace-of-horror
story.
