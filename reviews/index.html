    <h2>Reviews Database</h2>
<p>Here's a place for reviews by MITSFS members.

<p>If you're a MITSFS member and you'd like to review a book, please
do!  Read a few of the other reviews to get a sense of the style
(e.g. we're more interested in what sort of a book it is, rather than
assigning it a good/bad rating).  Although there's a preference for
new books, it's fine to review older books, especially when it's an
author that not everybody in the world reads.  An interesting and
well-explained opinion on any book, even one already reviewed, is
always welcome.  When you're done, email your review to
<b>kvetchcomm@mit.edu</b>.
