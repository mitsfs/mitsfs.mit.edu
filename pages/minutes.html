<h4>Archive for MITSFS Friday meeting minutes</h4>

<p> If you are really interested at what goes on at our meetings, you can read
what may be our <a href="/minutes/archive/latest/">latest minutes.</a> If you think
those are a fluke and we've got to be more intelligible than that most of the
time you can browse through some older minutes, but you're pretty much
doomed.</p>
