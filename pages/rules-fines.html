<h1>Library Rules</h1>
<ol>
  <li>RESERVE materials are not available for check-out. All reserve materials live in the main room and all magazines or bound magazines are reserve. Ask a Keyholder if you’re unsure if something is reserve.
    <ul>
      <li> Reserve materials do not leave the Library without the explicit permission of the Skinner.</li>
      <li> Special Reserve materials do not even leave the back area (Damnation Alley) without a special “sign-out” that allows an item to be read elsewhere in the Library.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>CIRCULATING materials are available for check-out. They are not supposed to have orange stickers, but some still do: ask the Keyholder if you’re unsure.
    <ul>
      <li> Members may borrow Circulating materials for up to twenty-one (21) days.</li>
      <li> Members may have a maximum of eight (8) items in circulation at any one time.</li>
      <li> ALL books must be signed out by a Keyholder.</li>
      <li> Only a member may sign out books on their membership. Anyone may return a member’s books.</li>
      <li> Books must be returned to the Library. There is a slot in the door for returns at arbitrary times; hence, that the Library was closed is not a valid excuse for overdue books.</li>
      <li> Books mailed back to the Library are considered returned as of the date of the postmark.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>BOOK DROP
    <ul>
      <li>Any batch of books left in the bookdrop must include a note with the borrower’s name, the list of titles being returned, and the date on which they are returned.</li>
      <li>Books too large to fit through the slot will have their due date extended by a week if a note is left in the book drop (with name, title, and date, as usual) indicating the problem. If an overdue book is extended this way, fines accrued before the extension still apply.</li>
      <li>Books cannot be renewed except by physically bringing them to the Library to check in and check back out. A note requesting that they be renewed is not sufficient. Note that if a book is on hold, it cannot be renewed.</li>
      <li>Books left without a card and date are considered returned as of the date they are found.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>FOOD and drink are generally not allowed in the Library.
    <ul>
      <li>Some non-messy foods may be permitted, in the front area only, at the discretion of the Keyholder on duty. Food never, ever goes into the stacks!</li>
      <li>Never Read or browse Library materials with food in your hands. Your hands should be reasonably clean when handling Library material; if they aren’t, wash them.</li>
      <li>Dragons are not permitted to eat the members.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>SMOKING is absolutely forbidden. Smokers are subject to expulsion and banishment.</li>
  <li>BAGS of any sort are not to go past the desks, not even a little bit. The banana-colored couch is the favored deposit location. Any bags that do wander forward may be relocated. Don’t even think about bringing a bag into the stacks.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Fine Rules</h1>
<ol>
  <li>Overdue fines are ten cents ($0.10) per day per item. Books are always due twenty-one (21) days after being taken out and books returned between midnight and 3am are considered to have been returned on the previous day.</li>
  <li>The maximum overdue fine is $4.00 / item (i.e. 40 days overdue, i.e. out for two full months).</li>
  <li>A book is considered lost when MITSFS is informed. Overdue fines stop accumulating when a book is reported lost, but any incurred on the book before then are still due. There is a replacement fee for lost items but, we would prefer to have lost circulating items replaced with another copy in the same format, in which case there is no lost book fine. The fines for unreplaced lost items are as follows:
    <ul>
      <li>Mass-Market Paperbacks: $15.00</li>
      <li>Hardcovers and Large Paperbacks: $40.00</li>
      <li>Unbound Magazines: $8.00</li>
      <li>Bound Magazines: $8.00/issue included + $30 binding fee</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The fine for removing an item from the library without signing it out, or for fraudulently signing an item out, is $1.00 per item.</li>
  <li>The fine for removing any item in Damnation Alley from the library is $2.00 per item. This fine is in addition to any other fines that might be incurred. Fines for unreplaced lost items from Damnation Alley are triple those for other material.</li>
  <li>The fine for returning books via the book drop without a note identifying the member and the books being returned is $0.50 per offense. Multiple books returned at the same time or multiple errors on the same card count as one offense. Books do not accumulate overdue fines once returned, even if unaccompanied by information. However, if no date is supplied, we will assume it was returned when we find it.</li>
  <li>Fine assessments may be appealed to the VGG or the Skinner. The decision of the Skinneris final. A member cannot check out books while an unpaid fine is being appealed. However, they may pay the fine to be able to check out books and appeal for a refund. These fine rules are in effect for all offenses committed on or after 15 August, 2014. 1A book that falls due during a time warp (usually declared over Winter Break) does not begin accumulating overdue fines until the time warp ends. Overdue books still bar members from checking out books, whether fines accumulate or not.</li>
</ol>
